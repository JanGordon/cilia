# cilia

A js framework built for ssr from the ground up

# goals
- all features should work both on client and ssr
- everything should be compiled to as little js as possible
- no adding to dom on page load unless user specified
- limited config files required (add as needed)

Cilia is desgined to be as quick as possible and deliver the best initial page load.

# things to add as of now
- css support
- ssr js runner
- custom api hooks with go
- html only reloading (otherwise do full reload)
